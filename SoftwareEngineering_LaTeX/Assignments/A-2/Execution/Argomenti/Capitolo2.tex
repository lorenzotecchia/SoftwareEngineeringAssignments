{\LARGE SOFTWARE IDEA}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The idea consist in a DBMS written in the C language. A DBMS is a tool for storing and retrieving stored data. It improves data managing and data collection. It must address problems like: fast data retrieval, consistency, data security, accuracy, response time, and memory requirements. The DBMS would be a relational one, providing data stored in tables ("relations"). Our DBMS would provide Libraries for string management, the ability to manage different users and different servers, and the ability to create Indexes.
	 \item Our customers would be any company, student, or developer that would be in need for a relational, secure, fast and modern DBMS. 
	\item The target group would be any programming inclined user. So a minimum level of knowledge about DBMSs would be expected. The DBMS might not be used/deployed because of other well known alternatives already exist, and Changing already existing Databases to use the DBMS may be difficult.

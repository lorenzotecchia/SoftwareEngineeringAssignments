	abstract = {Although software peer review has been practiced for more than four decades, software literature uses inconsistent and in many cases conflicting terms to refer to more or less the same activities. According to IEEE Std-1028 (IEEE 1028), inspection is ``A visual examination of a software product to detect and identify software anomalies, including errors and deviations from standards and specifications,'' and review is ``A process or meeting during which a software product, set of software product, or a software process is presented to project personnel, managers, users, customers, user representatives, auditors or other interested parties for examination, comment or approval.},

abstract={Substantial net improvements in programming quality and productivity have been obtained through the use of formal inspections of design and of code. Improvements are made possible by a systematic and efficient design and code verification process, with well-defined roles for inspection participants. The manner in which inspection data is categorized and made suitable for process analysis is an important factor in attaining the improvements. It is shown that by using inspection results, a mechanism for initial error reduction followed by ever-improving error rates can be achieved.},

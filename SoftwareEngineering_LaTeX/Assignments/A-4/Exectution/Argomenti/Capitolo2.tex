10 requirements of the c database:
- have tools to deal with strings
- able to manage different users
- able to manage different servers
- able to handel different datatypes
- be able to create indexes
- it should be secure
- data retrival should be timed
- data should be accurate
- data should be consistent
- it should be able to store data

a)
Grouping doesn't make too much sense because most Requirements apply to both groups.
Companies:
- have tools to deal with strings
- able to manage different users
- able to manage different servers
- able to handel different datatypes
- be able to create indexes
- it should be secure
- data retrival should be timed
- data should be accurate
- data should be consistent
- it should be able to store data
solo developers:
- have tools to deal with strings
- able to manage different servers
- able to handel different datatypes
- be able to create indexes
- it should be secure
- data retrival should be timed
- data should be accurate
- data should be consistent
- it should be able to store data

b)
Functional requirements:
- have tools to deal with strings
- able to manage different users
- able to manage different servers
- able to handel different datatypes
- be able to create indexes
- it should be able to store data
- data retrival should be timed
Nonfunctional requirements:
- data should be accurate
- data should be consistent
Safety/security requirements:
- it should be secure
Constraints:

or in a second view:

Ingenious requirements:
- it should be secure

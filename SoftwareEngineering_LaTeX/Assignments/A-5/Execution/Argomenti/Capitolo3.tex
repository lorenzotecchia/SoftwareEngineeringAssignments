Description    & A company wants to use the Database in a webshop to check if they can sell a product to a customer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\

Assumptions    & The product data is stored in the database, the data in the database is accurate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\

Variation      & The webserver could check if the user has already bought x of the product and reject their offer according to a x per person policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\

Non-Functional & The database must be able to handle multiple queries at once in order to process multiple orders at once                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\

Issues         & If requests are handeled simultaneously then how do you decide which user gets a product if there is only one available?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\
